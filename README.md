# ImmersiveGuards
This Eluna script will make it so you can walk up to guards and ask them questions and get dynamic responses.


This script is mostly just a proof of concept. All major cities work. Walk up to a guard and ask Where is X? X being something like Warrior trainer, fishing trainer, etc. The script looks for keywords and replies. Obviously you can right click the npc and just select an option but this is IMMERSIVE!üëç

Don't ask them the same question multiple times. They get annoyed. You can also thank them and they'll reply.
