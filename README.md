# ImmersiveGuards
This Eluna script will make it so you can walk up to guards and ask them questions and get dynamic responses.


This script is very early in development, but more of a proof of concept right now. Only Stormwind and Ironforge guards work. Walk up to them and ask Where is X? X being something like Warrior trainer, fishing trainer, etc. The script looks for keywords and replies. Obviously you can right click the npc and just select an option but this is IMMERSIVE üëç
